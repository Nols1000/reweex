reweex is a redux wrapper for webextensions. It uses the messaging system of the webextension-API to make redux stores available in all parts of a webextension.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install `reweex`.

```bash
npm install reweex
```

## Usage

First initialize a store-server in the background script:

```typescript
const store = createStoreServer(reducers);
```

Then initialize a store-proxy in any content-script or popup you would like to use redux:

```typescript
async function initApp() {
    const store = createStoreProxy();
}

initApp()
```

## Built With
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - programming language
